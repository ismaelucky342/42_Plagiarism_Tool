# ðŸš§In developmentðŸ‘·

The heatmap plagiarism detector for C projects was created after finding multiple suspicious evals. A staff member was also one of the first proponents of a similar tool on campus to investigate possible cases of plagiarism so it was also recommended by them. The tool aims to facilitate the detection of code similarities between various GitHub repositories and projects by providing a visual representation of shared code patterns through heatmaps. This project aims to streamline the review process and ensure academic integrity by highlighting possible cases of code reuse or duplication in C projects.

Its existence and future use in evals ensures that the quality of 42 educational method remains excellent. Remember that taking advantage of it, by cheating or copying code, to pass projects faster, will sooner or later end up harming you and the school.
